# SMS spam Classifier-NLP-Model-Deployment

Steps:
 

 Our ML systems workflow is like this:
 Train offline -> Make model available as a service -> Predict online.
•	A classifier is trained offline with spam and non-spam messages.
•	The trained model is deployed as a service to serve users.

Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail. Therefore, we’ll build a simple message classifier using Naive Bayes theorem.
